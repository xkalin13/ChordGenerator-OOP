# Note Frequencies
This readme contains basic structure and simplified ways to explain how sound and waves work.

## What are soundwaves
![SoundWave](img/soundwaves.gif)
Soundwaves are representation of change in air pressure in particular direction.
The key features of a sound is:
![Wave](img/wave.png)
* Module-Amplitude = how loud
and 
* Frequency - Period = what pitch/ how high a sound is.

![ear](img/ear.gif)
Those waves travel at the speed of sound 340 m/s and cause tiny hair inside our ear to vibrate in certain frequency, this then by ear changed into electrical impulses which are transmited into our brain...... and thats how we percieve sound.
But there is a huge limitation, human ear can only sense from 20 Hz - 20 kHz
![freq](img/frequencies.gif)
There could be infinite notes in this range, but human ear can only differentiate a certain amount of Hz, this has been studied for centuries and as a result we have a few notation systems- the most common one is the one using 8 notes C D E F G A B + C. Each note has been given a specific frequency - if the frequency is 2x the fundamental frequency we call that an octave.
