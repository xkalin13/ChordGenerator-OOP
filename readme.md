## Intro
This project was and idea of two students of Brno University of Technology - Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication - `BUT FEEC`  in short. It combines knowledge gained from Audio Engineering study programme and intermediate programming skills. So when it came to choosing a project, something which could apply music in any way, was immediately on mind.

## About 
The whole programme is made in C# lang. Particularly using Windows Forms App .net part.
